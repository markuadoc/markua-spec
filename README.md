This is the [Markua Spec](http://markua.com`), written by
[Peter Armstrong](https://twitter.com/peterarmstrong).

The Markua Spec is based on the CommonMark Spec, whose author is
[John MacFarlane](https://johnmacfarlane.net/).

This document also incorporates the specification of three of the five GitHub
Flavored Markdown (GFM) extensions from the [GFM
Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

Like the CommonMark Spec and the GFM Spec, the Markua Spec is licensed under
the Creative Commons license
[CC-BY-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

This document has two types of intended readers:

1. authors with advanced questions about Markua syntax
2. developers implementing Markua Processors

The Introduction contains a number of introductory sections about Markua and
its relationship to Markdown, CommonMark and GFM. It also contains sections
which discuss Leanpub, to minimize confusion for Leanpub authors who encounter
this document.

If you're going to read this document, you really should read the
[Introduction](http://markua.com/#introduction),
even if you normally skip them.
